# Scalar Multiplication of a Matrix
Difficulty: `easy`

## Description
When a matrix $A$ is multiplied by a scalar $k$, the operation is defined as multiplying each element of $A$ by $k$. Given a matrix $A$:
```math
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} \\ 
a_{21} & a_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
```

And a scalar $k$, the result of the scalar multiplication $kA$ is:
```math
kA = \begin{pmatrix} 
ka_{11} & ka_{12} \\ 
ka_{21} & ka_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
```
 
This operation scales the matrix by $k$ without changing its dimension or the relative proportion of its elements.
