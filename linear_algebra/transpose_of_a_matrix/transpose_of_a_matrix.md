# Transpose of a Matrix
Difficulty: `easy`

## Description
Consider a matrix $M$ and its transpose $M^T$, where: Original Matrix $M$:

```math
M = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b & c \\ 
d & e & f 
\end{pmatrix}
```
 
Transposed Matrix $M^T$:
```math
M^T = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & d \\ 
b & e \\ 
c & f 
\end{pmatrix}
```
 
Transposing a matrix involves converting its rows into columns and vice versa. This operation is fundamental in linear algebra for various computations and transformations.
