# Matrix times Vector
Difficulty: `easy`

Consider a matrix $A$ and a vector $v$, where Matrix $A$:
```math
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
```

Vector $v$:
```math
v = \begin{pmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{pmatrix}
```

The dot product of $A$ and $v$ results in a new vector:
```math
A \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}v_1 + a_{12}v_2 \\
a_{21}v_1 + a_{22}v_2
\end{pmatrix}
```
 
Things to note: an  matrix will need to be multiplied by a vector of size  or else this will not work.
